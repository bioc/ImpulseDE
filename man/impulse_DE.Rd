\arguments{
\item{expression_table}{numeric matrix of expression values; genes should
be in rows, samples in columns. Data should be properly normalized and
log2-transformed as well as filtered for present or variable genes.}

\item{annotation_table}{table providing co-variables for the samples
including condition and time points. Time points must be numeric numbers.}

\item{colname_time}{character string specifying the column name of the
co-variable "\code{Time}" in \code{annotation_table}}

\item{colname_condition}{character string specifying the column name of
the co-variable "\code{Condition}" in \code{annotation_table}}

\item{control_timecourse}{logical indicating whether a control time
timecourse is part of the data set (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{control_name}{character string specifying the name of the control
condition in \code{annotation_table}.}

\item{case_name}{character string specifying the name of the case
condition in \code{annotation_table}. Should be set if more than two
conditions are present in \code{annotation_table}.}

\item{expr_type}{character string with allowed values "\code{Array}" or
"\code{Seq}". Default is "\code{Array}".}

\item{plot_clusters}{logical indicating whether to plot the clusters
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_iter}{numeric value specifying the number of iterations, which are
performed to fit the impulse model to the clusters. Default is \code{100}.}

\item{n_randoms}{numeric value specifying the number of generated randomized
background iterations, which are used for differential expression analysis.
Default is \code{50000} and this value should not be decreased.}

\item{n_process}{numeric value indicating the number of processes, which can
be used on the machine to run calculations in parallel. Default
is \code{4}. The specified value is internally changed to
\code{min(detectCores() - 1, n_process)} using the \code{detectCores}
function from the package \code{parallel} to avoid overload.}

\item{Q_value}{numeric value specifying the cutoff to call genes
significantly differentially expressed after FDR correction (adjusted
p-value). Default is \code{0.01}.}

\item{new_device}{logical indicating whether each plot should be plotted
into a new device (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\value{
List containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{impulse_fit_results} List containing fitted values and model
parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{impulse_parameters_case} Matrix of fitted impulse model
parameters and sum of squared fitting errors for the case dataset. If a
control time course is present, corresponding list entries will exist for the
control and the combined dataset as well (named
\code{impulse_parameters_control} and \code{impulse_parameters_combined},
respectively).
\item \code{impulse_fits_case} Matrix of impulse values calculated based
on the analyzed time points and the fitted model parameters for the combined
dataset. If a control time course is present, corresponding list entries will
exist for the control and the combined dataset as well (named
\code{impulse_fits_control} and \code{impulse_fits_combined},
respectively).
}
\item \code{DE_results} List containg the results from the differential
expression analysis:
\itemize{
\item \code{DE_genes} data.frame containing the names of genes being called
as differentially expressed according to the specified cutoff \code{Q_value}
together with the adjusted p-values.
\item \code{pvals_and_flags} data.frame containing all gene names
together with the adjusted p-values and flags for differential expression
according to additional tests.
}
\item \code{clustering_results} List containing the clustering results:
\itemize{
\item \code{kmeans_clus_case} Numeric vector of clusters IDs, to which the
genes were finally assigned.
\item \code{cluster_means_case} Matrix containing the mean expression values
for each cluster (taken over all genes assigned to a cluster).
\item \code{pre_clus_case} Numeric number of clusters determined after the
first (preliminary) clustering step.
\item \code{fine_clus_case} Numeric number of final clusters determined after
 the second clustering step.
}
If a control time course is present, those four list entries will
exist correspondingly for the control and the combined dataset as well
(ending with \code{_control} and \code{_combined} instead of \code{_case},
respectively).

\description{
Fits an impulse model to time course data and uses this model as a basis
to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. If a single time course
data set is given, DE genes are detected over time, whereas if an
additional control time course data set is present, DE genes are
detected between both datasets.
}
\details{
\code{ImpulseDE} is based on the impulse model proposed by
Chechik and Koller, which reflects a two-step behavior of genes within a cell
responding to environmental changes (Chechik and Koller, 2009). To detect
differentially expressed genes, a five-step workflow is followed:
\enumerate{
\item The genes are clustered into a limited number of groups using k-means
clustering. If \code{plot_clusters} = \code{TRUE}, the clusters are plotted.
\item The impulse model is fitted to the mean expression profiles of the
clusters. The best parameter sets are then used for the next step.
\item The impulse model is fitted to each gene separately using the parameter
sets from step 2 as optimal start point guesses.
\item The impulse model is fitted to a randomized dataset (bootstrap), which
is essential to detect significantly differentially expressed genes
(Storey et al., 2005).
\item Detection of differentially expressed genes utilizing the fits to the
real and randomized data sets. FDR-correction is performed to obtain adjusted
p-values (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

\examples{
#' Install package longitudinal and load it
library(longitudinal)
#' Attach datasets
data(tcell)
#' check dimension of data matrix of interest
dim(tcell.10)
#' generate a proper annotation table
annot <- as.data.frame(cbind("Time" =
   sort(rep(get.time.repeats(tcell.10)$time,10)),
   "Condition" = "activated"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#' Time columns must be numeric
annot$Time <- as.numeric(annot$Time)
#' rownames of annotation table must appear in data table
rownames(annot) = rownames(tcell.10)
#' apply ImpulseDE in single time course mode
#' since genes must be in rows, transpose data matrix using t()
#' For the example, reduce iterations to 10, randomizations to 50, number of
#' genes to 20 and number of used processors to 1:
impulse_results <- impulse_DE(t(tcell.10)[1:20,], annot, "Time", "Condition",
   n_iter = 10, n_randoms = 50, n_process = 1)
