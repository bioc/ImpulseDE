# Introduction

*ImpulseDE* detects differentially expressed (DE) genes in high-throughput
time course experiments. It accepts two different kinds of inputs: 
whether a single time course dataset (1TK) or a dataset containing a case as
well as a control time course for each time point measured (2TK). 
For the first scenario, it identifies genes being differentially
expressed across time points. For the second scenario, *ImpulseDE* reports 
genes being differentially expressed between both conditions.
*ImpulseDE* follows a five-step workflow: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step               Explanation  
-----------------  ----------------------------------------------------------
Clustering         The genes are clustered into a limited number of groups  
                   using k-means. In default modus, *ImpulseDE* prints the 
                   plots for each cluster.  
                  
Fit to clusters    *ImpulseDE* is based on the impulse model proposed by 
                   Chechik and Koller, which  reflects a two-step behavior of 
                   genes within a cell responding to environmental changes 
                   [@chechikkoller2009]. This model is fitted to the mean
                   expression profiles of the clusters.  

Fit to genes       The best parameter sets obtained from the clusters are then
                   used to fit an impulse model to each gene. 

Fit to random data The impulse model is fitted to a randomized dataset
                   (bootstrap), which is essential to detect
                   differentially expressed genes [@storey2005].  

Detection of       Detection of differentially expressed genes utilizing the
differentially     fits to the real and randomized data sets. FDR-correction
expressed genes    is performed to obtain adjusted p-values [@bh1995].
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Requirements for input data
*ImpulseDE* requires an expression table (only numbers) as well as an annotation
table (characters allowed). The requirements for the two tables are the 
following:  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature            Explanation  
-----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
Expression table   Genes have to be in rows and samples in columns. Both rows
                   and columns should have unique identifiers.  
                   
Annotation table   Must have two columns, one carrying the timestamps as numeric
                   numbers and the other one carrying the condition information.
                   In the case of two time courses, two conditions are required.
                   More than two conditions are allowed to be specified, but
                   then two conditions (one case and one control conditions)
                   have to be specified by the user for each run separately. The
                   samples (row names) do not have to have the same order as in
                   the expression table (column names), but the sample
                   identifiers must be identical. Additional columns are allowed
                   but will be ignored later on.  
                   
Missing values     Are **not supported**. Genes having missing values for at
                   least one sample will be excluded from the analysis.  
                   
Time points        Since the parametric model contains six parameters, the
                   dataset should contain at least **six** time points.  
                   
Normalization      Gene expression data should be **properly normalized**
and filtering      including **log2-transformation** and **filtered** to avoid
                   spending time on fitting the model to non-informative
                   genes (e.g. not expressed or not variable genes). No impulse
                   model will be fitted to genes having a coefficient of
                   variation less than 0.025; instead, the mean across all
                   samples is returned as the "fit".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Calling ImpulseDE
The first four input parameters have to be specified by the user. Those are the
names of the two input tables (*expression\_table* and *annotation\_table*) as
well as the two column names carrying the time (*colname\_time*) and condition
(*colname\_condition*) information within the annotation table. Additional
parameters can be set to specify the time course scenario as well as fitting
and parallelization parameters.  
In the default modus, *ImpulseDE* expects a single time course scenario
without any control data (*control\_timecourse = FALSE* and *control\_name = 
NULL*). In the case of two time courses, the *control\_timecourse* parameter has
to be set to *TRUE* and for *control\_name* the name of the control within
*colname\_condition* has to be specified. If more than two conditions are
present within the annotation table, *case\_name* has to be set in
addition to run *ImpulseDE* for the desired case condition.  
Regarding the fitting, as default *ImpulseDE* will run 100 iterations 
(*n\_iter = 100*) to optimize the model parameters, generate 50.000 random data
points (*n\_randoms = 50.000*) to estimate bootstrapped p-values for DE analysis,
and determines DE genes using an FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff (q-value) of 1%
(*Q\_value = 0.01*). Furthermore, in default modus it will split the run into 4
processes (*n\_process = 4*). If parallelization is not possible on the device or
is not admired, *n\_process* should be set to *1*. 

## Output of ImpulseDE

*ImpulseDE* returns a list consisting of three sublists: *impulse\_fit\_results*,
*DE\_results* and *clustering\_results*. The first contains the fitted impulse
model parameters, sum of squared fitting errors as well as the calculated
impulse values for all time points. The second provides the names of the genes
being called as differentially expressed according to a specified cutoff
together with the adjusted p-values (*DE\_genes*) as well as the adjusted 
p-values, flags and results of additional tests for all genes 
(*pvals\_and\_flags*). The third speciFIes the clusters, to which the genes were
assigned to as well as the mean expression values for the clusters.

# Differential expression analysis for single time courses
In the case of a single time course experiment, *ImpulseDE* will detect
differentially expressed genes over time. A fitting dataset is provided within
the R package *longitudinal*, where T cells were stimulated with PMA and
ionomicin and harvested at 10 different time points [@rangel2004]. The dataset
contains 10 measurements per time point for 58 genes:

```{r chunk1}
# (Install package longitudinal) and load it
library(longitudinal)
# attach T cell data
data(tcell)
# check dimension of data matrix of interest
dim(tcell.10)
```

In order to be able to apply *ImpulseDE* on this dataset, *tcell.10* has to be
transposed using *t()* during the call since genes need to be in rows and
samples in columns. Additionally, it is necessary to create a proper
annotation table:

```{r chunk2}
# generate annotation table with columns "Time" and "Condition"
annot <- as.data.frame(cbind("Time" =
   sort(rep(get.time.repeats(tcell.10)$time,10)),
   "Condition" = "activated"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Time columns must be numeric
annot$Time <- as.numeric(annot$Time)
# rownames of annotation table must appear in data table
rownames(annot) = rownames(tcell.10)
head(annot)
```

It is important that the *Time* column contains numeric values and that the
*Condition* column is not a factor. Since the dataset contains only a sinlge
time course and therefore only one condition, the *Condition* column contains
only one unique value, *activated*.

## Running the analysis 1TK
*ImpulseDE* provides a single function, *impulse\_DE*, which runs all the
analysis steps automatically and prints the current status on the screen. To run
*ImpulseDE* with all default options, only four variables need to be set for the
single time course scenario: *expression\_table*, *annotation\_table*, 
*colname\_time* and *colname\_condition*. However, for demonstration purposes the
number of iterations, randomizations as well as the number of used processors
will be reduced. For real datasets, it not recommended to reduce *n\_iter* as
well as *n\_randoms*. Additionally, the analysis will be limited to the first 
20 genes:

```{r chunk3, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
# load package
library(ImpulseDE)
# start analysis
impulse_results <- impulse_DE(t(tcell.10)[1:20,], annot, "Time", "Condition",
   n_iter = 10, n_randoms = 10, n_process = 1, new_device = FALSE) 
```

(**Note**: *new\_device* is set to *FALSE* in all plot functions here to avoid
the generation of emtpy pages within the vignette. Usually, it is recommend to
keep this option *TRUE*, which will open a new device for each plot. Otherwise,
all earlier plots will be overwritten.)

## Plotting genes of interest 1TK

Plotting a custom list of genes can be done by using the function
*plot\_impulse*. For this the fitting results are needed, which can be taken from
the generated result object *impulse\_results*. As an example, some genes
being called as differentially expressed are plotted. 

```{r chunk4, fig.show = 'hold', fig.height = 7}
genes = c("SIVA","CD69","ZNFN1A1","JUND","ITGAM","SMN1","PCNA")
plot_impulse(gene_IDs = genes, data_table = t(tcell.10), data_annotation = annot,
    imp_fit_genes = impulse_results$impulse_fit_results,
    file_name_part = "four_NV_genes", new_device = FALSE)
```

For example, *JUND* and *CD69* show very typical impulse-like expression
patterns, which cleary change significantly over time.

## Imputing values for missing time points 1TK
To impute values for an uncovered time point for a specific gene, the following
command can be used:

```{r chunk5}
# impute expression value for time point 60 for gene "JUND"
(imp_results <- 
     calc_impulse(impulse_results$impulse_fit_results$impulse_parameters_case[
         "JUND",1:6], 60))
```

# Differential expression analysis between two time courses

In the case of a two time course experiment, *ImpulseDE* will detect
differentially expressed genes between both conditions. In order to generate
two time courses out of the T cell data set, the replicates will be splitted
and to the second half some random numbers are added:

```{r chunk6}
# split dataset into two halfs
case_data <-  t(tcell.10)[,seq(1,ncol(t(tcell.10)),2)]
control_data <-  t(tcell.10)[,seq(2,ncol(t(tcell.10)),2)]
# add some random values to "control_data" to make data different
control_data <- control_data + t(apply(control_data,1,function(x) 
    runif(length(x),0,0.5)*sample(c(-1,1),length(x), replace = TRUE)
    + sample(c(seq(-2,2,0.5)),1)))
tcell_2tk <- cbind(case_data, control_data)

```

At last, a proper annotation table has to be generated:

```{r chunk7}
annot_2tk <- annot[colnames(tcell_2tk),]
annot_2tk[51:100,"Condition"] = "control"
head(annot_2tk)
tail(annot_2tk)

```

## Running the analysis 2TK
In contrast to the single time course scenario, six variables need to be set:
*expression\_table*, *annotation\_table*, *colname\_time*, *colname\_condition*, 
*control\_timecourse* and *control\_name*. Here again, for demonstration purposes
the number of itertions, randomizations as well as the number of used processors
will be reduced. For real datasets, it not recommended to reduce *n\_iter* as
well as *n\_randoms*. Again, the analysis will be reduced to the first 20 genes:

```{r chunk8, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
# load package
library(ImpulseDE)
# start analysis
impulse_results <- impulse_DE(tcell_2tk[1:20,], annot_2tk, "Time", "Condition",
    TRUE, "control", n_iter = 10, n_randoms = 10, n_process = 1, new_device = FALSE)
```

## Plotting genes of interest 2TK
As an example, some genes being called as differentially expressed are
plotted as well:

```{r chunk9, fig.show='hold', fig.height = 7}
genes = c("SIVA","ZNFN1A1","IL4R","MAP2K4","ITGAM","SMN1","CASP8","E2F4","PCNA")
plot_impulse(gene_IDs = genes, data_table = tcell_2tk, data_annotation = 
    annot_2tk, imp_fit_genes = impulse_results$impulse_fit_results, 
    control_timecourse = TRUE,
    control_name = "control", file_name_part = "four_NV_genes_2tk", new_device = FALSE)
```

## Imputing values for missing time points 2TK
To impute values for an uncovered time point for a specific gene, *calc\_impulse*
has to be applied to both datasets separately:

```{r chunk10}
# impute expression value for time point 60 for gene "JUND"
# case data
(imp_results <- 
     calc_impulse(impulse_results$impulse_fit_results$impulse_parameters_case[
         "JUND",1:6], 60))
# control data
(imp_results <- 
    calc_impulse(impulse_results$impulse_fit_results$impulse_parameters_control[
    "JUND",1:6], 60))
```
