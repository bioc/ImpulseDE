Description: ImpulseDE is suited to capture single impulse-like
        patterns in high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a
        representative impulse model to each gene, it reports
        differentially expressed genes whether across time points in a
        single experiment or between two time courses from two
        experiments. To optimize the running time, the code makes use
        of clustering steps and multi-threading.
